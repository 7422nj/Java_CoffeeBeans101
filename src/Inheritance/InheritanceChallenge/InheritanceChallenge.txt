2. Create a class, “Car” that inherits from the base class - done -

4. You should be able to handle steering, changing gears, and moving (acceleration/deceleration) - done -
5. You will want to appropriately decide where to put the the states/behaviors (variables & methods) - done -
6. For the specific type of car, make sure you have at least 1 method that is specific to that car - done -
